## Design System

### Colors

|---|---|---|
| Background | `#fbfbff` | `#0d1117` |
| Surface | `#ffffff` | `#161b22` |
| Border | `#e5e7eb` | `#30363d` |
| Primary | `#275D2C` | `#3fb950` |

| Muted text | `#4b5563` | `#8b949e` |
| Error / Danger | `#931F1D` | `#f85149` |

**⚠️ Never use red (`#931F1D`) as a brand or accent color. Red is strictly for error/danger states only.**

### Typography
- Headings: **Playfair Display**
- Body/UI: **DM Sans**

## Styling Rules
- **Mobile-first.** Three breakpoints only: base (mobile), `md` (768px), `lg` (1024px). Do not use `sm`, `xl`, `2xl`.
- Dark mode via prefers-color-scheme media query, handled in globals.css — color tokens auto-flip. Do not add dark: variants in component code; tokens are already dark-mode-aware. No class-based toggle.
- Use exact color tokens above. Do not invent new dark mode colors.
- Hover: brand-green hover (hover:bg-primary etc.) only on primary/confirming actions. Chrome (sidebars, menus, secondary buttons) uses hover:bg-neutral-light.
- Focus rings: use focus-visible: not focus:.
- No motion library. The only blessed motion class is transition-colors duration-150.
- **Charting: recharts** is the standard charting library — do not add other charting libraries (added for the admin/stakeholder dashboard). Feed series the design-system color tokens as CSS vars (e.g. `stroke="var(--color-primary)"`) so charts auto-flip in dark mode. Chart components must be client components (`"use client"`) — recharts needs the DOM. Keep data fetching in TanStack Query hooks, never in the chart.
- <body> sets font-family: var(--font-sans) and h1...h6 use var(--font-heading) automatically (in globals.css). Do not add redundant font classes to headings or body. DO add font-heading to spans that need the heading font (e.g. brand text in headers

## Color token semantics
- `*-light` (e.g. `primary-light`, `danger-light`): tinted background fill,
  designed to pair with the strong color (e.g. `bg-primary-light text-primary`).
  Does NOT literally mean "a lighter shade." Values are tuned per mode for
  contrast — pale in light mode, deep-tinted in dark mode.
- `*-dark` (e.g. `primary-dark`): the hover/pressed state for the strong color.
  In light mode this is darker than the base; in dark mode it's brighter.
  Use it for interactive states, not as a "darker shade" primitive.

## Coding Rules
- TypeScript strict — no `any` without justification.
- All data fetching via **TanStack Query** — no raw `fetch` or `useEffect`-based fetching.
- Keep Landlord, Tenant, and Admin portal code **strictly separated** — do not mix concerns. The three portals are separate route groups: landlord under `app/dashboard/`, tenant under `app/(tenant)/`, admin under `app/(admin)/` (route `/admin/dashboard`). Each has its own `KeycloakInit` gate; the admin gate additionally bounces any non-admin portal to `/login`.
- Tenant names are **always a `<Link>`** to the Tenant Detail page, everywhere they appear (tables, cards, logs).

## Auth
- Keycloak handles auth. All authenticated requests: Authorization: Bearer <token>.
- Three roles: Tenant, Landlord, Admin. Auth state lives in shared useAuthStore; consume via the useAuth() hook.
- Role-specific domain state (e.g. tenantAccountStatus) is fetched from /me, not stored in the JWT.
- Tenants cannot self-register — landlords invite via email only.
- Lease acceptance screen comes before account creation/password setup.

## Testing
- Jest + React Testing Library. Jest resolves @/ alias via moduleNameMapper in jest.config.mjs.
- Use fireEvent, not userEvent.
- Tests import the component-under-test via relative path; shared utilities and types via @/.
- Mirror existing mock patterns (see Batch L1 / L2 tests for reference).

## API
- REST via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`. Whether calls are direct or proxied via Route Handlers is TBD — do not hardcode either pattern.

## Real-time (SignalR)
- Backend exposes a `NotificationsHub` at `/hubs/notifications`. Frontend connects via `@microsoft/signalr` with the JWT bearer token (passed as `?access_token=` for the WebSocket handshake).
- Server pushes events for payment + invite state changes; the client uses these as **signals only**, not as data.
- On every received event, the client calls `queryClient.invalidateQueries([...])` for the relevant query key. TanStack Query refetches authoritative data from the API.
- **TanStack Query remains the source of truth.** Do not store SignalR payloads as canonical state. Do not bypass the API to read pushed payloads as data.
- Connection management: one hub connection per authenticated session, lifecycle owned by a top-level provider (`SignalRProvider`). Auto-reconnect enabled with `withAutomaticReconnect()`.
- **Implemented in:**
  - `components/SignalRProvider.tsx` — the top-level provider. Mounted inside `components/Providers.tsx` (so it sits under the `QueryClientProvider` and can invalidate caches). Renders nothing — it's an effect host, not a context provider. Subscribes to `useAuthStore`; opens the connection on tenant/landlord login and tears it down on logout / portal switch.
  - `lib/realtime/connection.ts` — `buildHubConnection(url, tokenFactory)`: `withUrl` + `withAutomaticReconnect()` + `LogLevel.Warning`. The hub mounts at the API **root** (`/hubs/notifications`), so the URL is `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` + the path, **not** the `/api/v1` REST base.
  - `lib/realtime/events.ts` — `HUB_EVENTS` (wire method names, must match the backend `SignalRNotificationDispatcher`) and `invalidationKeysFor(portal)`, the portal-specific event→query-key map (e.g. `LeaseExpiringSoon` invalidates `tenant.lease()` for a tenant but `landlord.dashboard()` + `landlord.tenant.all()` for a landlord).
  - `lib/auth/keycloak.ts` → `getAccessToken()` — the async `accessTokenFactory`; refreshes via `updateToken(30)` so reconnects never present a stale JWT.
- **Does not connect** when: portal is `admin` (the hub assigns no group and aborts the connection server-side), `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true` (no real token), or `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is unset (MSW dev mode — no real backend / WS hub to reach).

## Analytics (M6.1 — PostHog)
- All product analytics go through the typed facade in `lib/analytics` — **never import `posthog-js` directly.** Use `capture(ANALYTICS_EVENTS.x, …)`; the payload shape is enforced per event by `AnalyticsEventProperties`.
- Add new events in `lib/analytics/events.ts` (name + payload contract) — the facade won't compile if an event lacks a contract.
- It's **env-driven and no-op without a key** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`), like `WebVitalsReporter`. Don't add the key to `requirePublicEnv` (analytics must not be a required build var).
- Identify/reset is handled centrally in `AnalyticsProvider` (root layout) by subscribing to `useAuthStore` — do not add `identify` calls in the portals.
- See `docs/milestones/m6-product-analytics.md` for the event taxonomy + funnel definitions.
- `autocapture` is **off** by design — we only send the explicit, typed events declared in `events.ts` (matches the `identified_only` privacy posture). Don't flip it back on without a deliberate decision.
- **Status: plumbed but OFF everywhere — no key is provisioned yet.** `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` is build-time-inlined (not a Helm/runtime env), so analytics is enabled per build:
  - **Local:** put a `phc_…` project key in `frontend/.env.local`.
  - **Cluster:** add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` GitHub **repo secret** (Settings → Secrets), then rebuild the frontend image — `frontend-ci.yml` bakes it in. No manifest change needed.
  - The key is a PostHog **project** API key (`phc_…`, publishable/write-only — safe to inline); NOT a personal API key.

## Follow-ups — landlord payment confirm/reject UI (PR #181)
The `useConfirmPayment` / `useRejectPayment` mutation hooks exist and match the backend
contract (`POST /payments/{id}/confirm`, `POST /payments/{id}/reject` with `{ reason }`),
but **no UI calls them yet** — `TenantDetailView` is read-only and the dashboard's
upcoming-payments table has no action buttons. When wiring the confirm/reject buttons +
reject-reason modal, carry these deliberately-deferred items:
- **Reject reason validation lives at the form boundary, not in the hook.** Enforce it with
  Zod — required, non-whitespace, **10–500 chars** — to mirror the server's
  `RejectPaymentValidator`. The hook intentionally does no validation (matches
  `useSubmitReceipt`); an empty reason currently round-trips to a server 400.
- **Error UX is the consumer's job.** Both hooks omit `onError` by design (matches
  `useDeleteProperty` / `useSubmitReceipt`) — the button/modal owns the toast/error state.
- **Cache invalidation is currently broad.** On success both hooks invalidate
  `queryKeys.landlord.tenant.all()` (list + detail) because they don't know the tenant id.
  If the consuming view has the `tenantId`, consider threading it through the mutation input
  and scoping to `queryKeys.landlord.tenant.detail(id)` to avoid an unneeded list refetch.

## Key Omissions (intentional)
- **v0.dev: opted out.** Do not suggest it.
